## This service is written is GO, But here the code is already compiled. So we will just use the binary and run it.

1. Create a user to run the servie 

```
# useradd dispatch
```

2. Clone the repo as user.

**Use Git Clone to get code**

3. Need to import `catalogue` service to the system, To manage with `systemctl`.
